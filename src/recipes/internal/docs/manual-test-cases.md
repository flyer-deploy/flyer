1. Test deploy:start task:

   - Verify that the deploy:start task executes the start command hook if it is specified in the configuration.
   - Verify that the deploy:start task does not throw any errors if the start command hook is not specified.

2. Test deploy:prepare task:

   - Set the environment variables (APP_ID, APP_USER, APP_GROUP, etc.) to valid values and ensure that the task sets the corresponding variables correctly.
   - Set the with_secure_default_permission environment variable to 1 and verify that the task checks if the setfacl command exists.
   - Set the with_secure_default_permission environment variable to 1 and ensure that the task displays a warning message if the setfacl command is not available.
   - Set the with_secure_default_permission environment variable to a non-1 value and verify that the task does not display any warning message.

3. Test deploy:additional task:

   - Set the additional_files_dir environment variable to a valid directory path and ensure that the task copies the files specified in the configuration to the release path.
   - Set the additional_files_dir environment variable to an invalid directory path and verify that the task throws an error message.

4. Test deploy task:

   - Invoke the deploy task and verify that it invokes all the necessary subtasks (deploy:prepare, deploy:release, deploy:permission, etc.) in the correct order.
   - Verify that the deploy task does not throw any errors during the deployment process.

5. Test cleanup task:

   - Set the release_list and new_release variables to valid values and invoke the cleanup task. Ensure that it deletes all the releases except the current release from the deploy path.
   - Verify that the cleanup task does not throw any errors during the cleanup process.
